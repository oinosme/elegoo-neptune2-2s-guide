# NOT READY YET

This was taken from the Autoleveling Firmware [here](https://github.com/mlee12382/Elegoo-Neptune-Firmware/blob/main/1.%20Auto_leveling-20210903.zip) and modified the .txt to remove the Autoleveling. However when flashing this there are no images in the display. Not sure if other issues.
