## Configuration Ultimaker Cura
The Elegoo Version of Cura, is just an older version of Ultimaker Cura with some parameters and Elegoo logo. Furthermore, on the macOS version, in order to be able to install it you have to disable security protections. You don't have to do this, and the best way is to just download Ultimaker Cura and set those parameters yourself.

1. Download Ultimaker Cura [here](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura)
1. Select add _non-networked_ > _Custom FFF printer_
1. On the _"Printer Settings"_ tab:
  * x = 235mm
  * y = 235mm
  * z = 260mm
  * Build plate shape = Rectangle
  * Origin center = **NOT** selected
1. Enable Heated bed
1. Go to the _"Extruder 1"_ tab
  * Compatible material diameter = 1.75mm
1. Click next
1. In printer settings (itâ€™s the box on your right over the bed grid)
  * Profiles = 0.2
  * Support = Disabled
  * Adhesion= Disabled

And that's it!
